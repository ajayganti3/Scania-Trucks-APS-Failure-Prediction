# Scania-Trucks-APS-Failure-Prediction
## Introduction:
Scania is a major Swedish manufacturer of commercial vehicles â€“ specifically heavy trucks and buses that are being used for the transportation of the goods between the places and also for the passenger travel.
## Business Problem:
The heavy trucks manufactured by Scania have a component called Air Pressure System (APS) which generates pressurized air that is utilized in various functions in a truck such as braking system and gear changes. The failure in the APS leads to breakdown of the vehicle which causes the abrupt stopping of the vehicle and also the cost of getting it repaired of the APS system is higher. So Scania came up with the problem that Is there a way to predict the failure of the APS given the sensor data that is collected from the trucks. so that abrupt APS failure will get reduced and the cost of the maintenance of the trucks will get reduced.
